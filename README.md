# Would You Rather...? Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React-Redux course, which is part of the [React Nanodegree program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

"Would you rather" is a party game that poses a dilemma in the form of a question beginning with "would you rather". The dilemma can be between two supposedly good options, two attrative choices or it can be between two supposedly bad options.

This web app meets the [project specifications](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1567/view) required by Udacity and in particular:
- the app provides a way to login, in the form of a simple predefined select
- the player can toggle beetween unanswered and answered questions
- from the unanswered list, the player can select a question and enter the poll card where he/she can cast his/her vote
- after having voted the player will be presented with a summary card which highlight his/her vote along with the percentage of the votes for each of the two possible answers.
- from the answered list the player can resume a previous summary card where he/she can check the current percentage of the votes.
- the player can create a new question
- a leader board can be accessed from a tab
- the player can logout
- a 404 page is shown whenever an invalid url is entered in the address bar.
